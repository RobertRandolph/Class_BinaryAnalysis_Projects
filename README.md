# Class: BinaryAnalysis Projects

## Class
Explore the security of files in depth, focusing on binary/assembly analysis.

### Notes
The projects were uploaded to my personal github from my schools, and some of the files were removed since they weren't necessary to showcase my code, and I didn't want to somehow cause problems for my professors regarding the files they provided (i.e. project requirements and pts).  
The goal of the project will be stated below, and any files I created and worked on will stay.  
Some projects weren't included as they weren't interesting enough or weren't applicable.  
Some project READMEs were updated to better explain the project.

## Project01 | PE Analysis Tool

### Goal
Create a basic Portable Executable (PE) Analysis tool in order to determine if a file or a directory of files is malicous, and create a report of said files.

### Notes
Programmed in python  
1 src file

## Project02 | Save Data & Attack Save

### Goal
Create and design a system that saves data in a secure fashion, and then attack your own system and try to modify or steal said data based on the design.

### Notes
Programmed in C++  
5 src files  
1 document file  
1 save file (example)
